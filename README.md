# elixir_hpc_hackaton
Day 1 - Friday, 28 May 2021, 10:00 - 16:00 CEST
Day 2 - TBD (planned for mid-June)
High-performance computing (HPC) is one of the areas where the ELIXIR Training Platform has recently identified training gaps. There is a shortage of available courses and training materials. To address this we will organize a two non-consecutive days ELIXIR Training Hackathon with the aim of preparing or adapting existing training materials on the subject, similar in style to the (HPC) carpentry.  We are inviting domain and training experts that are familiar with ELIXIR Training Platform activities to join the effort.
If you want to learn more about the hackathon, reach out to ELIXIR Slovenia (elixir@mf.uni-lj.si). To access this course, please create your account on ELIXIR-SI eLearning Platform (EeLP) with ELIXIR AAI and (if you are a confirmed hackathon attendee) EeLP admins will grant you access to the course.
